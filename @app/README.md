# @app

This folder contains the various components (aka "packages") of our project. We
use [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage
this monorepo, to help us to keep things separate without slowing development
speed. All components of this project are named `@app/*` so that we can
reference them from each other in a straightforward manner, e.g.

```ts
import { useAppQuery } from "@app/graphql";
```
