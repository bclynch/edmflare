        by adding a filter type = eventbrite or whatnot on the graphql call
    - ~~Maybe a nice little display of features like discuss shows with others,
      save for future, etc~~
* Search results page

      https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/4763#issuecomment-458650255
  - ~~Can search for word (artist, venue)~~
  - List and map view
  - ~~Implement event brite widget for buying tickets~~
    - There is a cross origin deal since localhost isn't https. Breaks the
      methods (like close modal). Once it's live online it should be okay. Need
      an affiliate link of our own and to put a few things in the env vars

* Setup google analytics
  - ~~For pages~~
  - For on some clicks (like buy tickets)
  - ~~Need to swap in correct account in index.html~~
* Settings page
  - ~~User setting to change frequency of email updates~~
    - Also what cities to watch. In settings
    - Going to need a table for this - probably identify region vs city I guesss
    - Something in footer with link to get notifications that pops alert to sign
      in if not
  - Unsubscribe
  - Change profile pic (down the line)
  - Delete account
  - ~~password stuff~~

## Feature Ideas

- List view for a region on a per day basis
- Email alerts on a weekly / semi weekly / monthly basis
- Filter by genre, venue, region, artist
- Follow feature. Would be adding a table for adding artists or venues and
  linking with a user. Can have a chronological feed of followed items with new
  things and maybe notification / email updates every some period of time.
- A page with new releases for the week that might pull from reddit playlist

## Design

- Device mocks https://mockuphone.com/#ios
- Email Templates - mailchimp

## Monetization

- Lifted results for venues who want to promote something
- Affiliate links for eventbrite, ticketfly, ticketmaster, seetickets, etix, etc
  (Ticketfly is \$.25 per purchase)
- Affiliate links to albums on amazon or something
- Affiliate links for accomodation https://www.stay22.com/

## Down the line

- PWA available with push notifications for followed artists or venues.
  - https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-push-notifications/
  - https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push
- Featured / hot / lifted events up top
- Maybe pull api stuff for artists from youtube / insta / etc if they have it
- App store apps
  - https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-is-how-you-build-native-mobile-apps-with-angular/code-sharing-angular-and-nativescript
  - https://blog.angular.io/apps-that-work-natively-on-the-web-and-mobile-9b26852495e7
- Add ig to home page + directions for add to homescreen

## Development server

Run `$ ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Testing PWA Features / Prod Build

- Make sure http server is installed globally
  - `$ npm install -g http-server`
- **Change out prod env vars apolloBaseURL and apiBaseURL with their localhost
  dev equivalents**
- Build prod bundle `$ ng build --prod` to create /dist folder

```
$ cd dist/edmflare
$ http-server -c-1 .
```

- Head to http://localhost:8080 to see app in action
  - Must use localhost for serviceworker to work. Otherwise http isn't secure

## Code scaffolding

Run `$ ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You
can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

- Run `$ ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in
  the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
- To run a staging build: `$ ng build --configuration=staging`
  - Staging setup env config https://angular.io/guide/build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via
[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Updating Production

- Web app uses a service worked so we need to break the cache when we update.
  Change the cache version in service-worker.js to do this and prompt users to
  do the same.
- Run `$ ng build --prod` to run an AoT build
- Use SFTP (cyber duck) to replace the www folder in /var/www/edmflare.com/html
  on the server

#### Analytics

- Wire in Google analytics for page views
- Wire in analytics for events

## Graphql / Apollo

### Code Generation

#### Run

`$ yarn client gql:build`

## Logo Work

- Great intro video logo for inkscape (inspo for logo here):
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmaYeZ5iDPo
- Inkscape (svg) / gimp (for maing transparent png)
- Nice favicon generator https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- App logo generator https://makeappicon.com/

### Export svg from Inkscape

- Select the object(s) to export
- Open the document properties window (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- Select "Resize page to drawing or selection"
- File > Save As Copy...
- Select Optimized SVG as the format if you want to use it on the web
